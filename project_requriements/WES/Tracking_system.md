- Team: Viapath Genome Informatics
- Stakeholders: Viapath Genome Informatics, Viapath Genetics laboratories
- Other key relationships: 
Genomics England

## Current Status
Draft 

## Purpose
A system which reads Genomics England API to identify samples which are ready to be interpreted and reported by the GMC.
These samples can then be tracked through the laboratory steps.


## Project Goals & Objectives
Enable sample tracking through the required lab processes


## Requirements
### Functional
* Import samples that have a status of sent to GMC
* Record CIP ID and GEL proband ID
* Assign statuses to track progress through lab milestones

### Technical
* Incorporated into Moka
* Usable by all users on Trust windows computers.

### Usability
* Easy to use
* Must be consistent with existing Moka data structures and application logic
